## Introduction

The project for analyzing and predicting housing prices in Tricity, written in Python, is divided into 4 stages:
* Scrapper - retrieves data about apartments from a website using the Selenium package.
* Data Cleaning - we clean and change the data from the website, add new columns using Pandas. We add geographical coordinates using the Geopy library.
* Data Visualization - we present the results of data analysis using the Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn libraries.
* Prediction of Apartment Prices - we create a Random Forest model using the SciKit Learn library and predict the price of an apartment with the parameters we choose

## Setup

* It is necessary to download the libraries available to run the program
* All programs in folders run using jupyter notebook
